                Julio's first job was at a busy stock exchange, where he learned all about how financial markets work. This early exposure to how the market works and how to invest gave him important information that would help him become a leader in finance later on.

            <p className="pt-3">
                His drive and knowledge helped him quickly move up the ranks in the banking world over the years. He was already shaping the strategic direction of major financial institutions by the time he was in his late twenties. This showed that he was a good leader and knew how to deal with complicated financial situations.
